# movie-filter-sample

This is a sample code for testing out capabilities of Azure Cosmos Db and Apache Tinkerpop

This project contains a data uploader and a simple REPL. The data uploader is used against an Azure CosmosDb Emulator.

* Build the uploader project
* run `uploader --nuke`
* run `uploader upload user`
* run `uploader upload movie`
* run `uploader upload review`

Run the REPL or gremlin console towards Azure CosmosDb Emulator and try out your gremlin query! :)
